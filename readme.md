#About Project
If it wasnt for time i would implement MVC Structure, Write Completely Abastract library to iterate and fetch data from the API way more faster.
Right now it takes about 420.8128s to fetch all data by not triggering "Too many requests" from the api using a limiter.
I would also use service container and not calling services based on singleton pattern, use DTO's to avoid data error's.
I would integrate validation in almost every part of project.
I would handle production and development environment better, basically i have a perfect idea of how i would do this project if i had enough time.
